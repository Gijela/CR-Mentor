</div>

In daily development, code review is often seen as a "necessary process," but we believe it should be a "golden moment" for team growth, knowledge accumulation, and personal improvement.
CR-Mentor was born from the idea of leveraging AI and knowledge bases to make every code review truly inspiring and valuable.

## What Are We Doing?

CR-Mentor is not just an intelligent code review tool, but a developer growth platform. Through the following innovative features, we help you and your team continuously improve:

### 1. Deep Code Understanding: Powered by Deepwiki

- We integrate deepwiki technology, which can automatically track and analyze all files related to code changes, understanding cross-file and cross-module reference chains, truly achieving "global perspective" code analysis.
- No longer limited to git diff, LLMs can now "understand the entire project."

### 2. Building Developer Profiles: Insights into Your Growth Trajectory

- We not only analyze individual PRs but can also automatically analyze all commits and PRs in a GitHub user's history.
- With this data, CR-Mentor builds a unique "user profile" for each developer: technical strengths, common issues, and growth curves at a glance.
- This helps individuals review their growth and provides data support for team management and talent development.

### 3. Knowledge Base: Preventing Experience Loss

- Highlights, pitfalls, and best practices discovered during reviews can be saved to the knowledge base with one click.
- We provide MCP (knowledge management capability), supporting structured storage, retrieval, and reuse of personal or team knowledge points.
- Every thought and inspiration you have can become a valuable asset for your team.

### 4. Custom Rules and Risk Identification

- Supports uploading team-specific code standards and dependency documentation, so LLMs no longer "make things up."
- Agents can automatically identify potential risks and proactively provide professional advice to help you avoid pitfalls.

## What You Will Get

- A code review assistant that truly "understands you"
