  prReportText: "# Pull Request Summary\n\n## Walkthrough\n\nThis PR introduces a comprehensive code analysis system using Tree-sitter for TypeScript/JavaScript parsing. It adds knowledge graph generation capabilities, dependency analysis, and refactors the core architecture to improve file handling and token estimation. The changes significantly enhance the project's ability to analyze code structure and relationships.\n\n## Changes\n\n| Files | Change Type | Summary |\n|-------|-------------|---------|\n| dist/index.d.ts, dist/index.js | feat | Add TypeScript declaration file and compiled JavaScript for the public API including interfaces for AnalyzeOptions, FileInfo, AnalysisResult, and knowledge graph related types. |\n| src/core/codeAnalyzer.ts | feat | Implement Tree-sitter based code analyzer that parses TypeScript/JavaScript files, extracts code elements (functions, classes, interfaces), and builds a knowledge graph of relationships. |\n| src/core/errors.ts | refactor | Improve error handling with descriptive comments and standardize error naming conventions. |\n| src/core/gitAction.ts | refactor | Replace GitHandler with new GitAction class for Git operations using simple-git library. |\n| src/core/scanner.ts | refactor | Simplify file path resolution logic, improve module file finding, and update file scanning to use token estimation instead of file size. |\n| src/index.ts | refactor | Update GitIngest class to use new components, integrate code analysis, and modify result structure to include knowledge graph and dependency information. |\n| src/types/index.ts | refactor | Update type definitions to support new features including code analysis, knowledge graph, and token-based metrics. |\n| src/utils/analyzeDependencies.ts | feat | Add dependency analysis using dependency-cruiser to generate dependency graphs. |\n| src/utils/graphSearch.ts | feat | Implement knowledge graph search functionality to find related nodes and edges based on entity names. |\n| src/utils/index.ts | refactor | Improve token estimation algorithm with better handling of Chinese characters and remove unused summary generation functions. |\n| README.md, README-zh.md | docs | Add comprehensive documentation in both English and Chinese explaining features, usage, and configuration options. |\n| .github/workflows/build_dependency_graph.yml | ci | Add GitHub Actions workflow to build and analyze dependency graphs. |\n| package.json, tsconfig.json | build | Update package metadata, dependencies, and TypeScript configuration. |\n| .cursorrules, .gitignore | chore | Add editor configuration and update ignored files. |\n| Multiple example files | removed | Remove example files including scanner.ts, branch-analysis.ts, dependency-analysis.ts, index.ts, server.ts, and web interface files. |\n| Multiple core files | removed | Remove legacy dependency and git analysis modules including analyzer.ts, enhanced-scanner.ts, git.ts, and branch-analyzer.ts. |\n| Multiple type definition files | removed | Remove obsolete type definitions for dependency and git functionality. |\n| Configuration files | removed | Remove environment configuration files (.env.example) and web documentation. |\n\n## Architecture Changes\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph \"Before\"\n        GitIngest1[\"GitIngest Class\"]\n        GitHandler[\"GitHandler Class\"]\n        Scanner[\"Scanner Class\"]\n        GitAnalyzer[\"Git Analyzer\"]\n        DependencyAnalyzer[\"Dependency Analyzer\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph \"After\"\n        GitIngest2[\"GitIngest Class\"]\n        GitAction[\"GitAction Class\"]\n        FileScanner[\"FileScanner Class\"]\n        CodeAnalyzer[\"CodeAnalyzer Class\"]\n        GraphSearch[\"Knowledge Graph Search\"]\n        DependencyCruiser[\"Dependency Cruiser\"]\n    end\n    \n    GitIngest1 --> GitHandler\n    GitIngest1 --> Scanner\n    GitIngest1 --> GitAnalyzer\n    GitIngest1 --> DependencyAnalyzer\n    \n    GitIngest2 --> GitAction\n    GitIngest2 --> FileScanner\n    GitIngest2 --> CodeAnalyzer\n    CodeAnalyzer --> GraphSearch\n    FileScanner --> DependencyCruiser\n```\n\n## Code Review\n\nAfter reviewing the code diff, I've identified the following critical issues:\n\n### 1. Missing Error Handling in analyzeDependencies\n\n**Path**: src/utils/analyzeDependencies.ts  \n**Line**: 17-19\n\nThe function swallows errors and doesn't return any value in the error case, which will cause undefined to be assigned to the dependencyGraph property in the analysis result. This could lead to runtime errors when consumers try to access properties of the dependency graph.\n\n\n\nThe function should return a default empty structure or propagate the error to allow proper handling by the caller.\n\n### 2. Potential Memory Leak in CodeAnalyzer\n\n**Path**: src/core/codeAnalyzer.ts  \n**Line**: 56-57\n\nThe CodeAnalyzer class accumulates code elements and relations without any mechanism to clear them between analyses of different files. This could lead to memory issues with large codebases and incorrect relationships between unrelated files.\n\n\n\nWhile the code does create a new instance of CodeAnalyzer in src/index.ts:185, there's no reset method for when analyzing multiple files with the same instance, which happens in the loop at src/index.ts:188-205.\n\n### 3. Incorrect Constructor Name Resolution\n\n**Path**: src/core/codeAnalyzer.ts  \n**Line**: 522-525\n\nThe code attempts to get the name of a constructor, but constructors don't have names in TypeScript/JavaScript. This could lead to incorrect node identification and relationship mapping.\n\n\n\nThe code should use a fixed name like \"constructor\" for constructor methods instead of trying to extract a name.\n\n### 4. Unhandled Promise Rejection in analyzeFromDirectory\n\n**Path**: src/index.ts  \n**Line**: 222\n\nThe `analyzeDependencies` function returns a Promise, but the await is inside an object literal which means any rejection will cause an unhandled promise rejection.\n\n\n\nThis should be handled with proper try/catch or by awaiting the promise before constructing the return object.\n\n### 5. Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability\n\n**Path**: src/core/scanner.ts  \n**Line**: 283-291\n\nThe code constructs file paths from user input without proper validation, which could potentially lead to path traversal attacks if malicious import paths are provided.\n\n```typescript\n// 将相对路径转换为绝对路径\nconst fullPath = path.resolve(path.dirname(this.currentFile), importPath);\n\n// 确保路径以 .ts 结尾\nif (!fullPath.endsWith('.ts')) {\n  return `${fullPath}.ts`;\n}\n```\n\nThe code should validate and sanitize import paths before resolving them to prevent accessing files outside the intended directory.\n\n## Knowledge Graph Implementation Comparison\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph \"Before\"\n        GitAnalysis[\"Git Analysis\"]\n        DependencyScanning[\"Dependency Scanning\"]\n        FileSize[\"File Size Metrics\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph \"After\"\n        CodeParsing[\"Tree-sitter Parsing\"]\n        ElementExtraction[\"Code Element Extraction\"]\n        RelationDetection[\"Relation Detection\"]\n        KnowledgeGraph[\"Knowledge Graph\"]\n        GraphSearch[\"Graph Search\"]\n        TokenEstimation[\"Token Estimation\"]\n    end\n    \n    CodeParsing --> ElementExtraction\n    ElementExtraction --> RelationDetection\n    RelationDetection --> KnowledgeGraph\n    KnowledgeGraph --> GraphSearch\n    TokenEstimation --> KnowledgeGraph\n```\n\nNotes: The PR introduces significant architectural changes to the git-analyze project, replacing the previous file scanning and analysis approach with a more sophisticated code analysis system using Tree-sitter. The critical issues identified could impact the reliability, security, and performance of the system, particularly when dealing with large codebases or untrusted input. The PR removes several legacy components and replaces them with a more integrated and feature-rich architecture focused on code knowledge graph generation and analysis.\n\nWiki pages you might want to explore:\n- [System Architecture (Gijela/git-analyze)](/wiki/Gijela/git-analyze#2)\n- [GitIngest (Gijela/git-analyze)](/wiki/Gijela/git-analyze#3.1)"
