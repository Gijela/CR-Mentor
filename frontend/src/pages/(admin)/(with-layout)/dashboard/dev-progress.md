# CR-Mentor Visualization Enhancement Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Knowledge Base Search Enhancement

- ✅ Created KnowledgeHeatmap component to visualize knowledge topic coverage
- ✅ Added knowledge topic distribution statistics API and query functionality
- ✅ Integrated heatmap component into knowledge base search tab

### Phase 2: Developer Insights Enhancement

- ✅ Created ChartTypeSelector component for chart type switching
- ✅ Created ChartPanel component to solve type error issues
- ✅ Added data visualization summary features to DataTable component
- ✅ Enhanced SectionCards with mini trend charts and card interaction

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. TypeScript Type Errors

- **Problem**: Multiple type errors in ChartAreaInteractive component affecting compilation
- **Solution**: Created a new ChartPanel component with simplified type structure to avoid errors

### 2. Component Data Flow

- **Problem**: Maintaining data consistency between multiple components, especially chart type switching
- **Solution**: Implemented state lifting pattern, elevating chart type state to parent component

### 3. Data Visualization Enhancement

- **Problem**: Adding trend charts to static cards without historical data
- **Solution**: Created a mock data generator to provide trend visualization effects

## Next Steps

1. Performance Optimization:

   - Implement lazy loading and virtual scrolling for large datasets
   - Optimize chart component re-rendering logic

2. Testing & UX Improvements:

   - Add unit tests and integration tests
   - Collect user feedback and optimize interaction experience

3. Data-Driven Enhancements:
   - Replace mock data with real API data
   - Optimize data aggregation and filtering algorithms
